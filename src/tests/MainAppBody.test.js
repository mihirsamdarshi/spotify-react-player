// This test suite uses a distinct testing technique called _snapshot testing_. Go take
// a peek at the code then come back here for more commentary.
//
// Note how, with snapshot testing, you are truly dependent on that descriptive text.
// The enforcement is in the snapshot match, not a condition that is in the test code.
// This is where snapshot testing differs from traditional test-driven development:
// _It assumes that the code works initially._ This actually does line up fairly well
// with user interface development, because it tends to be easier to just “eyeball” a
// user interface first rather than write tests against it.
//
// It takes some adjustment to start “trusting” a snapshot test, just as it takes some
// adjustment to trust version control. If you want to manually check whether a snapshot
// is truly in the state that you want it to be, you can always look at the .snap file
// within the __snapshots__ folder.
